## Overview

Our AY22/23 Sem 2 CS2113 (Software Engineering) Team Project
A CLI based fitness tracker intended to give users a way to manage and learn new workouts


## Summary of Contributions

Here are the contributions done by myself to FitnessDuke

## Features Contributed:

### Feature: ```find```
* What it does: This feature would allow the user to find exercises based on a specified keyword from our mini json database
  of exercises. The name of the exercises will then be printed out to the user.
* Justification: This would help users to be able to conveniently search for the full names of the exercises, while also
  exploring other possible types of exercises that may interest them in trying.
* Highlights: This feature filters and loads data containing the specified keyword from the resources folder, before
  returning an ArrayList of the filtered data output to the user.

### Feature: ```IPPT calculator ```
* What it does: Provides the user as a way to track his Individual Physical Proficiency Test(IPPT) progress,
and being able to calculate the total points he obtains from the session.
* Justification:By imbuing as a new exercise session, this reduces the hassle for the user to spend the extra time to search his IPPT 
progress via another platform/app, and he can now use one single program to do the exercise and know the number of points obtained from his progress.

### Enhancements to existing features
* Fixed bugs and issues related to the feature, where some keywords inputted by user will not reflect the relevant exercises being outputted.

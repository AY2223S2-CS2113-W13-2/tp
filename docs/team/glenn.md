## Overview

Our AY22/23 Sem 2 CS2113 (Software Engineering) Team Project
A CLI based fitness tracker intended to give users a way to manage and learn new workouts


### Summary of Contributions

1. Included UI and exceptions aspect

2. Feature: ```find```
* What it does: This feature would allow the user to find exercises based on a specified keyword from our mini json database
  of exercises. The name of the exercises will then be printed out to the user.
* Justification: This would help users to be able to conveniently search for the full names of the exercises, while also
  exploring other possible types of exercises that may interest them in trying.
* Highlights: This feature filters and loads data containing the specified keyword from the resources folder, before
  returning an ArrayList of the filtered data output to the user.
